# Train-Status-Notifier
Train Status Notifier is a solution leveraging ML, DL and NLP techniques to detect contextual information from public chatroom of mIndicator application and summarize it for sharing with all users of mIndicator. 
Context such as people in the chatroom discussing about train delays, cancellations, accidents and other emergency situations are captured and summarized. 
Also a list of trending topics are infered from the chat data at regular interval of time to give a sense of which railway stations or trains are being discussed most about. 

This project was developed while participating in a hackathon organized by Mobond, the company who has developed mIndicator application.
